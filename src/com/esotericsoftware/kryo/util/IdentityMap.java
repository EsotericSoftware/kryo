/** An unordered map that uses identity comparison for the object keys. Null keys are not allowed. No allocation is done except
 * when growing the table size.
 * <p>
 * This class performs fast contains and remove (typically O(1), worst case O(n) but that is rare in practice). Add may be
 * slightly slower, depending on hash collisions. Hashcodes are rehashed to reduce collisions and the need to resize. Load factors
 * greater than 0.91 greatly increase the chances to resize to the next higher POT size.
 * <p>
 * Unordered sets and maps are not designed to provide especially fast iteration.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses linear probing with the backward shift algorithm for removal. Hashcodes are rehashed using Fibonacci
 * hashing, instead of the more common power-of-two mask, to better distribute poor hashCodes (see <a href=
 * "https://probablydance.com/2018/06/16/fibonacci-hashing-the-optimization-that-the-world-forgot-or-a-better-alternative-to-integer-modulo/">Malte
 * Skarupke's blog post</a>). Linear probing continues to work even when all hashCodes collide, just more slowly.
